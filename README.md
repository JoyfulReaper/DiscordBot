DiscordBot
==========
A Discord Bot written in C# using the Discord.NET library. This bot uses Dapper as the ORM and currently uses SQLite as the database engine. 
If you find this bot useful, but would perfer a different database engine please let me know as I would like to look into adding support for other databases later.
